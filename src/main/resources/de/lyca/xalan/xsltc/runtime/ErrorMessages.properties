# Note to translators: the substitution text in the following
# message is a class name. Used for internal errors in the
# processor.
runTimeInternalErr = Run-time internal error in ''{0}''

# Note to translators: <xsl:copy> is a keyword that should not be
# translated.
runTimeCopyErr = Run-time error when executing <xsl\:copy>.

# Note to translators: The substitution text refers to data types.
# The message is displayed if a value in a particular context needs
# to be converted to type {1}, but that's not possible for a value
# of type {0}.
dataConversionErr = Invalid conversion from ''{0}'' to ''{1}''.

# Note to translators: This message is displayed if the function
# named by the substitution text is not a function that is
# supported. XSLTC is the acronym naming the product.
externalFuncErr = External function ''{0}'' not supported by XSLTC.

# Note to translators: This message is displayed if two values are
# compared for equality, but the data type of one of the values is
# unknown.
equalityExprErr = Unknown argument type in equality expression.

# Note to translators: The substitution text for {0} will be a data
# type; the substitution text for {1} will be the name of a
# function. This is displayed if an argument of the particular data
# type is not permitted for a call to this function.
invalidArgumentErr = Invalid argument type ''{0}'' in call to ''{1}''

# Note to translators: There is way of specifying a format for a
# number using a pattern; the processor was unable to format the
# particular value using the specified pattern.
formatNumberErr = Attempting to format number ''{0}'' using pattern ''{1}''.

# Note to translators: The following represents an internal error
# situation in XSLTC. The processor was unable to create a copy of
# an iterator. (See definition of iterator above.)
iteratorCloneErr = Cannot clone iterator ''{0}''.

# Note to translators: The following represents an internal error
# situation in XSLTC. The processor attempted to create an iterator
# for a particular axis (see definition above) that it does not
# support.
axisSupportErr = Iterator for axis ''{0}'' not supported.

# Note to translators: The following represents an internal error
# situation in XSLTC. The processor attempted to create an iterator
# for a particular axis (see definition above) that it does not
# support.
typedAxisSupportErr = Iterator for typed axis ''{0}'' not supported.

# Note to translators: This message is reported if the stylesheet
# being processed attempted to construct an XML document with an
# attribute in a place other than on an element. The substitution
# text specifies the name of the attribute.
strayAttributeErr = Attribute ''{0}'' outside of element.

# Note to translators: As with the preceding message, a namespace
# declaration has the form of an attribute and is only permitted to
# appear on an element. The substitution text {0} is the namespace
# prefix and {1} is the URI that was being used in the erroneous
# namespace declaration.
strayNamespaceErr = Namespace declaration ''{0}''\=''{1}'' outside of element.

# Note to translators: The stylesheet contained a reference to a
# namespace prefix that was undefined. The value of the
# substitution text is the name of the prefix.
namespacePrefixErr = Namespace for prefix ''{0}'' has not been declared.

# Note to translators: The following represents an internal error.
# DOMAdapter is a Java class in XSLTC.
domAdapterInitErr = DOMAdapter created using wrong type of source DOM.

# Note to translators: The following message indicates that the XML
# parser that is providing input to XSLTC cannot be used because it
# does not describe to XSLTC the structure of the input XML
# document's DTD.
parserDtdSupportErr = The SAX parser you are using does not handle DTD declaration events.

# Note to translators: The following message indicates that the XML
# parser that is providing input to XSLTC cannot be used because it
# does not distinguish between ordinary XML attributes and
# namespace declarations.
namespacesSupportErr = The SAX parser you are using does not have support for XML Namespaces.

# Note to translators: The substitution text is the URI that was in
# error.
cantResolveRelativeUriErr = Could not resolve the URI reference ''{0}''.

# Note to translators: The stylesheet contained an element that was
# not recognized as part of the XSL syntax. The substitution text
# gives the element name.
unsupportedXslErr = Unsupported XSL element ''{0}''

# Note to translators: The stylesheet referred to an extension to
# the XSL syntax and indicated that it was defined by XSLTC, but
# XSLTC does not recognize the particular extension named. The
# substitution text gives the extension name.
unsupportedExtErr = Unrecognized XSLTC extension ''{0}''

# Note to translators: This error message is produced if the
# translet class was compiled using a newer version of XSLTC and
# deployed for execution with an older version of XSLTC. The
# substitution text is the name of the translet class.
unknownTransletVersionErr = The specified translet, ''{0}'', was created using a version of XSLTC more recent than the version of the XSLTC run-time that is in use.  You must recompile the stylesheet or use a more recent version of XSLTC to run this translet.

# Note to translators: An attribute whose effective value is
# required to be a "QName" had a value that was incorrect. 'QName'
# is an XML syntactic term that must not be translated. The
# substitution text contains the actual value of the attribute.
invalidQnameErr = An attribute whose value must be a QName had the value ''{0}''

# Note to translators: An attribute whose effective value is
# required to be a "NCName" had a value that was incorrect.
# 'NCName' is an XML syntactic term that must not be translated.
# The substitution text contains the actual value of the attribute.
invalidNcnameErr = An attribute whose value must be an NCName had the value ''{0}''

unallowedExtensionFunctionErr = Use of the extension function ''{0}'' is not allowed when the secure processing feature is set to true.

unallowedExtensionElementErr = Use of the extension element ''{0}'' is not allowed when the secure processing feature is set to true.

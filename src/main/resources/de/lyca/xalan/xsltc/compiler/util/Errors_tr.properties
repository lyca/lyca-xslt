# Note to translators: This message describes an internal error in the processor. The term "byte code" is a Java

# Note to translators: This message describes an internal error in the processor. The terms "OutlineableChunkStart" and

# between that same enclosing pair.
outlineErrUnbalancedMarkers = Internal XSLTC error\:  OutlineableChunkStart and OutlineableChunkEnd markers must be balanced and properly nested.

# Note to translators: This message describes an internal error in the processor. The term "byte code" is a Java
# technical term for the executable code in a Java method. The "method" that is being referred to is a Java method in a

# the instrutions in the Java byte code in that method. "Outlined" is a technical term internal to XSLTC and should not
# be translated.
outlineErrDeletedTarget = Internal XSLTC error\:  an instruction that was part of a block of byte code that was outlined is still referred to in the original method.

# Note to translators: This message describes an internal error in the processor. The "method" that is being referred to
# is a Java method in a translet that XSLTC is generating.
outlineErrMethodTooBig = Internal XSLTC error\:  a method in the translet exceeds the Java Virtual Machine limitation on the length of a method of 64 kilobytes.  This is usually caused by templates in a stylesheet that are very large.  Try restructuring your stylesheet to use smaller templates.
